<p>FACULTY_NAME,</p>

<p>STUDENT_NAME (STUDENT_ID) dropped your COURSE_SECTION class on DROP_DATE.</p>

<p>Federal Regulations require the last date of attendance to be reported within 14 days of a student dropping a course. In order to comply with regulations, the last date of attendance must be entered on or before LAST_DATE.</p>

<p>Please use the following steps to enter the Last Date of Attendance for the above student:</p>

Go to <a href="https://portal.delta.edu/">Portal</a> > Campus Links > MyDelta (WebAdvisor) > WebAdvisor For Faculty > Faculty Information > Grading
<ul>
<li>Click on Term.</li>
<li>Click “Final” Grading and the class.</li>
<li>On the grading roster, the student should already have W grade without a last date of attendance.</li>
<li>Enter the Last Date of Attendance for the student.</li>
<li>Click submit and a confirmation page will be displayed.</li>
<li>Click submit, you will be taken back to the faculty menu.</li>
</ul>
Since this process is extremely time-sensitive, we ask that you immediately complete the steps above.  Additional emails will follow on the following time frame if attendance information is not completed:
<ul>
<li>5 days from student-initiated drop</li>
<li>10 & 12 days from student-initiated drop (instructor and division chair to receive email)</li>
</ul>
